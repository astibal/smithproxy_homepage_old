# Configuration

Smithproxy is not that simple software. You need to configure it properly, before really using it:

### Networking
If not done yet, please finalize your network environment. Configure linux interfaces as intended. Ideal is  to have:

* external interface name (ie. ens0)
* internal interface name (ie. ens5) -- all connections received here will be intercepted

Now open configuration file `/etc/smithproxy/smithproxy.startup.cfg`, and change `SMITH_INTERFACE` variable to your *internal* interface name. This is interface, where almost all *routed* traffic will be inspected (meaning redirected to tproxy and processed by smithproxy). You can also have a look on other options and change them to your liking.

For my appliance it looks like this:
``` 
:::text
...
# # SMITH_INTERFACE # 
# # used to specify where the TPROXY will be applied. It should be usually i
# # the internal interface, heading to user machines which will be mitm'ed.
# # Action: you should adjust it according to your network setup.
# 
SMITH_INTERFACE='ens9'
...
```

### Certificate authority
You cannot magically break into or hack TLS. In order to do TLS MitM, you need certificate authority your applications trust which signs all faked certificates for you. There is default one pre-installed by smithproxy. You can use it, but   don't do that, please. There is a script `sx_regencerts` which can create one for you.

```

> `sx_regencerts` generates CA pair, server cert pair, client pair (not used) and portal cert. 
Portal certificate is most tricky one and `sx_regencerts` tries to play it smart.  

* CA key-pair - used to fake original certificates
* Server cert key-pair - certificate is not used, only public and private key in it.  
    key-pair is used to be construct CSR to generate faked certificate and then signed by CA.
* Portal cert - This is certificate for smithproxy login portal, if authentication is used.  
    This portal FQDN is configurable in config file (see `settings/auth_portal/address setting`). It could be IP, but FQDN is nicer and preferred.

Ok, now `smithproxy` is finally using an unique CA certificate keypair. SSL applications passing smithproxy *MUST* trust this CA certificate, in order to work properly. You can display certificate issing this command:

```
:::text

```

** === IMPORTANT:** The certificate file **MUST** be imported to application trusted CA certificate list. 

You can also visually check it using openssl command:
```

### Main configuration file */etc/smithproxy/smithproxy.cfg*
This file contains most of smithproxy settings to make it run. It's pre-set for safe values which won't hurt probably anyone. It's not configured for any capture, TLS security, bypass or any from other smithproxy fancy features.

#### Traffic policies
Probably first thing you gonna touch are policies. Let's have a look at one, allowing all traffic. They are processed top-down and contain many other settings and profiles. They look this way in their simplest form:
```
:::text
policy = (
    {
        proto = "udp";
        src = "any";
        sport = "all";
        dst = "any";
        dport = "dns";
        tls_profile = "default";
        detection_profile = "detect";
        content_profile = "default";
        auth_profile = "resolve";
        alg_dns_profile = "dns_default";
        action = "accept";
        nat = "auto";
    },
    {
        proto = "tcp";
        src = "any";
        sport = "all";
        dst = "any";
        dport = "all";
        tls_profile = "default";
        detection_profile = "detect";
        content_profile = "default";
        auth_profile = "resolve";
        alg_dns_profile = "dns_default";
        action = "accept";
        nat = "auto";
    }
)

```

#### Policy elements

First policy matches all *UDP* traffic. As you see, they contain different identifiers, referring to their own, respective config parts (6 is really TCP and 17 UDP):
```
:::text
proto_objects = {
    tcp = {
        id = 6;
    }
    udp = {
        id = 17;
    }
}
```
Also, there are IP address and port-range configuration objects.

First, let's see address objects:
```
:::text
address_objects = {
    any = {
        type = 0;
        cidr = "0.0.0.0/0";
    }
    root = {
        type = 1;
        fqdn = "www.root.cz";
    }
}
```
We have here two types, address (0) and fqdn (1). FQDN address is one learned from DNS. But don't worry, if it's not, smithproxy is trying to periodically refreshing them.
... and finally port objects:
```
:::text
port_objects = {
    all = {
        start = 0;
        end = 65535;
    }
    dns = {
        start = 53;
        end = 53;
    }
}
```
These are *matching* parts of policy. That being said, these are compared to traffic in order to decide if actions specified in the policy will be (or not) applied to the traffic. Obviously, if traffic matches, next policies are not attempted to match or process.

#### Policy Actions

```
:::text
policy = (
    {
        // ... action elements 
        action = "accept";
        nat = "auto";
    },
```
`action = [ "accept" | "reject" ]`  
`nat = [ "none" | "auto" ]`

Setting `action = "accept"` or `reject` is obvious (accepting - passing traffic, or dropping it).  
Setting `nat = "none"` controls if traffic is attempted to keep its original IP and source port. This is supported for TPROXY traffic origin. Setting `nat = "auto"`, smithproxy will let it up to OS to decide what IP and port will be used (IP of outbound interface, and port from dynamic so-called ephemeral pool). 

##### Profile policy elements 

Let's start with example:
``` 
:::text
    },
    {
        // ....
        tls_profile = "default";
        detection_profile = "detect";
        content_profile = "default";
        auth_profile = "resolve";
        alg_dns_profile = "dns_default";
        // ....
    },
```
These are influencing what *will be done with the connection*:
 
* tls_profile - modify all related to TLS
* detection_profile - sets up flow-aware pattern matching engine on the connection
* content_profile - should be content changed, or ie. dumped into a file (.smcap)?
* auth_profile - should IP be authenticated (portal redirection)?
* alg_dns_profile - DNS settings, transparent DNS cache

#### Advanced configuration
We can't cover everything in quick howto document. However, you might be interested in following, most-frequently used features:

* Content dumping
* TLS parameters suitable for wireshark decryption


##### Content dumping to files
Content dumping is NOT enabled by default. To write content into files, you need to:
1) set existing directory where to save .smcap files
```
:::text
settings = {
    // ...
    write_payload_dir = "/var/local/smithproxy/data";
    // ...
}
```
2) configure policy profile
```
:::text
content_profiles = {
    writer = {
        write_payload = TRUE;
        write_limit_client = 0;
        write_limit_server = 0;
    }
```
3) apply profile created above on the policy 
```
:::text
policy = (
    {
        proto = "tcp";
        src = "any";
        sport = "all";
        dst = "any";
        dport = "all";
        tls_profile = "default";
        detection_profile = "detect";
        content_profile = "writer";          // <--------------
        auth_profile = "resolve";
        alg_dns_profile = "dns_default";
        action = "accept";
        nat = "auto";
    }
)
```
4) restart smithproxy using `service smithproxy restart`

If followed correctly, you should now see in the directory .smcap files:
```
:::text
root@cr3:/var/local/smithproxy# find .
.
./data
./data/192.168.122.1
./data/192.168.122.1/2019-10-21

``` 

Smcaps are human-readable hexdump text files, later replayable by pplay tool.

```
PPlay has its own howto on the project landing page here [pplay](https://pypi.org/project/pplay/).  
You can easily install it with 

```
:::text
pip install pplay
```


##### SSL keylog

To enable keylog dumping, please edit corresponding TLS profile:
```
:::text
tls_profiles = {
    default = {
        // ...
        sslkeylog = TRUE;   # <-----------------------
```
... and restart smithroxy with `service smithproxy restart` to reload configuration.

You should see ssl keylog file `/var/log/smithproxy.0.sslkeylog.log`,  
directly usable by wireshark in `Protocol preferences > SSL > (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename`.

# Starting smithproxy

If everything above is set, you can start smithproxy using standard 
```
:::text
service smithproxy start
```
To make smithproxy start on boot, issue this command:
```
:::text
update-rc.s
```

# Smithproxy CLI
Smithproxy has its own CLI. Run `smithproxy_cli`, you will get output as follows:

```
:::text
root@cr3:~# smithproxy_cli 
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
--==[ Smithproxy command line utility ]==--

smithproxy(cr3) > 

```
run 
```
:::text
smithproxy(cr3) > enable
Password: 
smithproxy(cr3) #
```
to get privileged access. 

There are various command areas. Main are:

* `diag` - diagnostic output right to the CLI
* `debug` - set debug level for various aspects of smithproxy
    * `debug term` - sets output verbosity of CLI terminal
    * `debug file` - sets output verbosity for log file (`/var/log/smithproxy.log` by default)
* `configure` - this one is not yet implemented fully
* `save` - this one is not yet implemented fully

For example:
```
:::text
smithproxy(cr3) # diag proxy session list
