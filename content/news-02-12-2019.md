As you might have already noticed, OpenSSL 1.0.x and Python2 both have announced End-Of-Life to the last day of year 2019.
Therefore they will **not** be actively maintained and updated anymore.  
This might be a bit sad, because of nostalgy - we all know how long they have been with us, and served well!

You can check EoL announcements here:  
[Python 2.7 Release Schedule](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/)  
[OpenSSL: New LTS Release](https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2018/05/18/new-lts/)  

Anyway, smithproxy, as any other open-source project depending on openssl and python, has to move on.   
Because of this, there are some changes coming with the begining of 2020.

> * Smithproxy **0.8** will no longer be actively maintained.
    It makes little sense to continue with updates, there will be none
    from openssl1.0 and python2.
* Smithproxy **master** branch will be 0.8 successor, in the intermediate
    state until **0.9** is be released. 
* Docker images currently tagged *latest* and based on **0.8** will be renamed to *legacy*
* Docker images currently tagged *testing* and based on **master** will be renamed to *latest*


## Smithproxy 0.8 - EoL 
0.8 was quite good release. It was definitely one of most stabilizing releases smithproxy software had.
It runs well on all systems I have seen and is also quite fast, you can check my post on patreon with some speedtest checks.

To be practical, these are last 0.8 binary packages with version tag *0.8.5-64* for:  

   * [Debian9](http://www.mag0.net/out/smithproxy/0.8/Linux-Debian-9/smithproxy_0.8.5-64_amd64.deb)
   * [Ubuntu 16.04](http://www.mag0.net/out/smithproxy/0.8/Linux-Ubuntu-16.04/smithproxy_0.8.5-64_amd64.deb)
   * [Ubuntu 18.04](http://www.mag0.net/out/smithproxy/0.8/Linux-Ubuntu-18.04/smithproxy_0.8.5-64_amd64.deb)
   * [Ubuntu 18.10](http://www.mag0.net/out/smithproxy/0.8/Linux-Ubuntu-18.10/smithproxy_0.8.5-64_amd64.deb)
